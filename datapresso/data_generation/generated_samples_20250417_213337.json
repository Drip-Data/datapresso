        "rationale": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n with respect to x is n*x^(n-1). Applying this rule to each term in the function:\n1. The derivative of 3x^2 is 2*3x^(2-1) = 6x.\n2. The derivative of 2x is 1*2x^(1-1) = 2.\n3. The derivative of a constant (-5) is 0.\nCombining these results, the derivative of the function is 6x + 2.",
