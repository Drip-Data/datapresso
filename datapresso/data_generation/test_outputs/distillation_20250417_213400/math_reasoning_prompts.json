    "responde": "<think>\n- **Concept Identification**: Exponential equations with different bases (2 and 5) require logarithms to solve for the variable in the exponent.\n- **Strategy Selection**: Apply natural logarithm to both sides and use logarithmic properties to linearize the exponents.\n- **Key Insights**:\n  - Use the power rule of logarithms: \\(\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)\\).\n  - Rearrange terms to isolate \\(x\\).\n  - Simplify using logarithmic identities.\n</think>\n\nRationale:\n1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\ln(2^{x+1}) = \\ln(5^{1-2x})\n   \\]\n2. Apply the logarithm power rule:\n   \\[\n   (x + 1)\\ln(2) = (1 - 2x)\\ln(5)\n   \\]\n3. Expand and rearrange terms to isolate \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x\\ln(2) + \\ln(2) = \\ln(5) - 2x\\ln(5)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x\\ln(2) + 2x\\ln(5) = \\ln(5) - \\ln(2)\n   \\]\n4. Factor out \\(x\\) from the left side:\n   \\[\n   x(\\ln(2) + 2\\ln(5)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n5. Solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(50)} = \\frac{\\ln(5) - \\ln(2)}{\\ln(2) + 2\\ln(5)}\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(50)}}"
